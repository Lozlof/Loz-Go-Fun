The statement you provided highlights a common challenge in software development, especially when dealing with versioning and public APIs (like modules). Here's a breakdown of the issue:

1. **Current Situation**:  
   You have a function, `Hello`, in a Go module (for example, `example.com/greetings`), and it currently takes a single parameter (like a name) as input. Let's say this function looks something like this:

   ```go
   func Hello(name string) string {
       return "Hello, " + name
   }
   ```

2. **Desired Change**:  
   You want to modify this `Hello` function so that it can accept multiple names instead of just one. A common way to do this might be by changing the parameter from a single `string` to a slice of strings (`[]string`). For example:

   ```go
   func Hello(names []string) string {
       // Return greetings for multiple names
   }
   ```

3. **Impact of the Change**:  
   By changing the function's signature (the number and/or types of its parameters), any user who has already written code that calls `Hello` with a single string (like `Hello("Alice")`) will see their programs break after this change. For example, a user may have code like:

   ```go
   greeting := greetings.Hello("Alice")
   ```

   If you change the function signature to require a slice of names, their code will no longer compile because `"Alice"` (a string) is not compatible with `[]string` (a slice of strings). The user would have to change their code to something like:

   ```go
   greeting := greetings.Hello([]string{"Alice"})
   ```

4. **Breaking Changes and Versioning**:  
   In Go and many other programming languages, when you publish a module that others rely on, changing a function's signature is considered a **breaking change** because it forces users to update their code. This can lead to frustration, bugs, or downtime for users relying on your module.

5. **Solutions**:  
   To avoid breaking users' programs, you can adopt various strategies:
   - **Create a new function**: Instead of modifying the existing `Hello` function, you could add a new function, like `HelloMultiple`, that takes a set of names. This way, the old `Hello` function remains unchanged, and existing users' code won't break.
   - **Use backward-compatible changes**: If the function can be adapted to handle both single and multiple names without changing the signature (perhaps using variadic parameters), you can avoid breaking changes.
   - **Versioning**: You could release a new version of your module (e.g., `v2`) with the new function signature. This allows users to decide when to upgrade, but their existing code won't break until they opt to update to the new version.

In summary, changing a function’s parameter from a single name to a set of names modifies its signature, which can break existing users’ code if they depend on your module. Careful consideration and backward compatibility are essential when making such changes.
